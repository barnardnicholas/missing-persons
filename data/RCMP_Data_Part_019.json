The men departed as a group in three separate boats and were heading for Warpath. At approximately 7:30 p.m. that same day, the occupants of the first boat reported to the RCMP that the other two boats were missing. They described the waves as being three to four feet high and they could not see the tree line from where they were. They lost sight of the other two boats and fired shotgun shots into the air hoping for a response. No response was received. Extensive patrols by air, boat and land were made in an attempt to locate the remaining five men. The bodies of Fredrick Ursu and Jerry Hudy were never recovered. Mr. Ursu and Mr. Hudy are presumed dead due to drowning.",

Witnesses saw Shelley-Anne walking westbound along the shoulder of Highway 16 carrying her school books; she was not hitch-hiking. Shelley-Anne was last seen in the area of what was then the western edge of town. A dark colored van was seen in the area around the time Shelley-Anne was walking home, some reports were that it was stopped at the side of the road near where she was last seen. An extensive search for the van and/or its occupants was not successful. Several days after Shelley-Anne was last seen, some of her belongings were found near the Athabasca River not far from the outskirts of Hinton.",

    "CaseDesc": "On June 6, 1979 James Gordon Nevin departed from his residence in Amherstburg, Ontario heading west for a 2 week vacation with the intention of visiting relatives. Mr. Nevin had a grandson in Winnipeg, Manitoba and a son in Prince George, British Columbia. Neither relative had prior notification Mr. Nevin's intentions to visit.   On June 14, 1979 the RCMP responded to a call and James Nevin's vehicle, a 1974 white/maroon Dodge Coronet, was located in a ditch between Rocanville, Saskatchewan and St. Lazare, Manitoba. Inquiries reveal the vehicle was at this location since June 8, 1979.   Mr. Nevin has never been seen again and likely went missing between 1:30 pm and 3:00 pm on June 8, 1979. Extensive searches were conducted by land and air all with negative results. James Gordon Nevin was never seen again. Foul play cannot be ruled out.",
