    "CaseDesc": "On November 3, 1972, a helicopter carrying a pilot and three passengers went missing in Lake Winnipeg. The helicopter left Thompson, Manitoba at 3:20 p.m. and was heading for Winnipeg after stopping at a number of communities. The helicopter landed at Warren's Landing at approximately 5:20 p.m., and left for Winnipeg. The pilot reported that the weather was poor and he estimated his arrival in Winnipeg at 8:00 p.m. At 5:50 p.m. there was radio contact with the pilot where he stated that he was over Poplar River. This was the last radio contact with this helicopter. The Canadian Air Search and Rescue, private aircraft and police aircraft searched until November 17, 1972 when the search was suspended until the spring of 1973. Nathan Kryger and Ian Fraser are presumed dead as a result of the helicopter crash. Foul play is not suspected.",
