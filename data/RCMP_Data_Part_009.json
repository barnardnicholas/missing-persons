The sudden shift caused both men to lose their footing and the canoe to overturn. The men attempted to move closer to shore by pushing the canoe. After a time, Mr. Harper told his friend he was too tired to hold on any longer. His companion continued moving the canoe. The survivor then realized Mr. Harper was no longer hanging on.
