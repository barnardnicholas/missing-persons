    "CaseDesc": "During the weekend of August 18, 1972, Dennis Simpson and a friend left for a fishing trip on McMillian Lake. When they failed to return by the 22nd, numerous people contacted police. Through investigation it was later determined that both men were last seen by a man on shore on Sunday the 20th, and their camp was still set up. They told the individual that they were going to make one more pass and then intended to break camp. Weather conditions at the time were such that there would have been rough water. Given this and the fact that the men were in a fairly small canoe, it was determined they may have capsized. An extensive land, water and air search did not find anything other than various articles that were identified as belonging to the two missing fishermen. Mr. Simpson has never been located.",
