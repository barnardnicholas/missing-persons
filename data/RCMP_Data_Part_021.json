Unfortunately, after a lengthy and comprehensive investigation police have been unable to find any trace of Julia.  Police along with Julia\u2019s friends and family are gravely concerned for Julia's wellbeing as she has been out of contact for a year now.  It is completely out of character for Julia to be out of contact with her friends and family for so long, especially with her 3 year old son.  Police are appealing to anyone with information about Julia's movements and activities in the days and weeks leading up to October 31st, 2013, to get in touch with investigators immediately.",

On August 18, 1978, three members of the expedition were on shore guiding in a canoe. The remaining 5 members including Craig remained in the canoe. As these individuals labored to guide the canoe to shore, the rope was given some slack. This caused the bow of the canoe to turn out into the current, which in turn caused the canoe to tip. The individuals on shore were unable to hold onto the rope due to the strength of the current and the canoe was carried downstream. Craig hung onto the canoe for a couple hours then was seen letting go. He slipped under the water and did not resurface. Mr. Waldum's remains have not been recovered and foul play is not suspected in this matter.",
