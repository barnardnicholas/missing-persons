One group, which included Hank, left the shore. They were however unable to get their boat started and as a result they began to drift backwards towards the rapids. This group called for help and the other boat went to their aid. Hank jumped from his boat and swam to the second one. Once they reached the disabled boat everyone was told to get in. Both boats encountered the rapids. It is assumed Hank drowned as a result of the mishap.",

A search was initiated and police found a boat submerged upright on the bottom of the lake. The depth of the lake around the boat was only 8 to 10 feet deep. It appeared to Police that the men encountered extremely rough water while crossing Moose Lake. The motors were both found to be in forward gear.
