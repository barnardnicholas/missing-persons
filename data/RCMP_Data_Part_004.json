    "CaseDesc": "On August 26th, 1986 Terry FIELD and Linda BLACKWELL left Lost Nation Airport, east of Cleveland, Ohio en route to Brantford Municipal Airport, Brantford, Ontario.  The plane was 18 minutes into its flight when the pilot communicated with Cleveland Air Traffic Control that they were encountering severe turbulence.  They requested new vectors to fly. The pilot was advised to turn west, then Air Traffic Control lost radio and radar contact with the plane. Debris from the plane was located on August 27, 1986 in Lake Erie, approximately 32 nautical miles south of the St.Thomas Airport. Debris was drifting in a southeast direction and was recovered approximately 1-3 nautical miles on the Canadian side of the international boundary line in Lake Erie. Debris was identified by Bud FIELD,  brother of Terry FIELD, as having come from the missing aircraft.",

Cyril was experienced at navigating along this river route, however water conditions at that time had been very high as a result of the spring flooding. The pair soon encountered strong currents and large amounts of debris on the river. In the process of trying to navigate to shore the boat capsized causing both men to enter the water. Both men were wearing life jackets. Extensive searches conducted by land, air, water and dragging operations several miles along the river all with negative results. Mr. Detimmerman was never found and is presumed dead due to drowning.",
